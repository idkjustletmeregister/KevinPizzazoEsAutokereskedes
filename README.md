# Restaurant console app

The idea to create a console app where I could order food from a restaurant was introducet to me by my mentor. He wanted me to learn C#, so I could help him develop the test automation framework at our workplace.  
"Kevin Pizzázó és Autókereskedés" is a meme page on Facebook and since my mentor was helping me to learn C# in our free time after work, I thought why not spice this up a little bit with this theme, just to make it more fun for the after hours.  
The project is not finished unfortunately due to mostly time related reasons - in the future I am planning on transforming this app into a more complex and fancy one with a GUI.

This whole work took approximately 10-12 hours to code in multiple runs with additional stops, code reviews, etc.
